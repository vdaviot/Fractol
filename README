How to :

Use ./fractol [fractal type] [iteration number (optionnal)]

Available fractal types are :

-Mandel
-Julia
-Ship
-Triangle

Shortcut :

[R] for reload the colorset.
[Q] for black and white colors.
[W] for activate/desactivate orbit trap coloring mode. (in progress,
	it will be available only for julia and mandel)
[E] for activate/desactivate smooth coloring mode. (in progress, done for julia, it will be available only for julia and mandel)
[Arrow] will move the fractal.
[+] for incrementing the iteration counter.
[-] for decrementing the iteration counter.
[Mouse] can be used in Julia's set for moving constant numbers.
[Mousewheel Up/Down] for zoom 
[Escape] button for exit the program.

Thanks to use my program, hope you'll enjoy it !
